# Tasks: Declarative Plugin Management

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-specify-scripts-bash/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: This feature specification requires comprehensive test coverage (80%+ on core logic) per Constitution Principle II (Test-First Development). All test tasks follow TDD workflow: RED (write + fail) ‚Üí GREEN (implement) ‚Üí REFACTOR (improve).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Single project structure (Zsh CLI tool)
- Source code: `lib/` at repository root
- Tests: `tests/contract/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/unit/`
- Entry point: `zap.zsh` at repository root

---

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Declare Desired Plugin State (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Users declare their desired plugin configuration in a `plugins=()` array, and Zap automatically loads all plugins on shell startup without requiring repetitive imperative commands.

**Independent Test**: Create a `plugins=()` array in `.zshrc`, source `zap.zsh`, and verify all declared plugins are loaded automatically.

### Tests for User Story 1

**TDD WORKFLOW (per constitution)**:
1. **RED**: Write tests first, run them, verify they FAIL
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimum code to make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests green

- [x] T025 [P] [US1] Integration test for version-pinned plugins in tests/integration/declarative/test_version_pinning.bats
- [x] T026 [P] [US1] Integration test for subdirectory plugins in tests/integration/declarative/test_subdir_plugins.bats
- [x] T027 [P] [US1] Integration test for empty array (no plugins loaded) in tests/integration/declarative/test_empty_array.bats

- [x] T032 [US1] Add state metadata tracking for declared plugins in _zap_load_declared_plugins() in lib/declarative.zsh
- [x] T033 [US1] Add logging for declarative plugin loading in lib/declarative.zsh
- [x] T034 [US1] Performance test for startup time (< 1s for 10 plugins) in tests/integration/declarative/test_performance.bats

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently. Users can declare plugins in an array and they load automatically.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Experiment with Temporary Plugins (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Users can try new plugins temporarily without modifying their configuration file, enabling fearless experimentation with the confidence they can return to their declared state.

**Independent Test**: Run `zap try owner/repo`, verify the plugin loads, then restart shell and confirm the experimental plugin is NOT reloaded.

### Tests for User Story 2

**TDD WORKFLOW**: RED (write + fail) ‚Üí GREEN (implement) ‚Üí REFACTOR (improve)

- [x] T039 [P] [US2] Security test for try command validation in tests/contract/declarative/test_try_security.zsh

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T040 [P] [US2] Implement zap try command function in lib/declarative.zsh
- [x] T041 [US2] Add validation logic (reuse _zap_validate_plugin_spec) in zap try in lib/declarative.zsh
- [x] T042 [US2] Add check for already-declared plugins in zap try in lib/declarative.zsh
- [x] T043 [US2] Add check for already-loaded experimental plugins in zap try in lib/declarative.zsh
- [x] T044 [US2] Implement plugin download logic (reuse existing downloader) in zap try in lib/declarative.zsh

- [x] T046 [US2] Add state metadata update (mark as experimental) in zap try in lib/declarative.zsh
- [x] T047 [US2] Add success/error messages for zap try in lib/declarative.zsh
- [x] T048 [US2] Add --verbose flag support for zap try in lib/declarative.zsh

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently. Users can declare plugins AND experiment with temporary plugins.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Reconcile to Declared State (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Users can return their shell to the exact state defined in their configuration file with a single command, regardless of what experimental changes they've made during the session.

**Independent Test**: Load experimental plugins, run `zap sync`, and verify runtime state matches config file exactly (experimental plugins removed).

- [ ] T068 [US3] Write unit test for drift calculation in tests/unit/declarative/test_drift_calculation.zsh

**Checkpoint**: All P1 user stories (1, 2, 3) should now be independently functional. This represents the core declarative paradigm: declare, experiment, reconcile.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Adopt Experiments (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Users can promote successful experiments to their declared configuration with a single command, automatically updating their config file.

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Inspect State Drift (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Users can view the difference between their declared configuration and current runtime state, understanding exactly what would change if they reconcile.

---

## Phase 8: User Story 6 - Multi-Machine Sync (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Users maintain identical plugin configurations across multiple machines by syncing their dotfiles repository, with Zap automatically reconciling each machine to the declared state.

**Independent Test**: Push config to git from one machine, pull on another, and run `zap sync` to verify state convergence.

- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational completion (can run in parallel with US1)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational completion, benefits from US1+US2 (but can run independently)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational completion, requires US2 (zap try) and US3 (state updates)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on Foundational completion, benefits from US1+US3 (but can run independently)
- **User Story 6 (Phase 8)**: Depends on Foundational completion, requires US1+US3 (declarative loading + sync)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 2, 3 Only - Core Declarative Paradigm)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T022) - CRITICAL, blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T023-T034) - Declarative loading
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T035-T048) - Experimentation
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (T049-T068) - Reconciliation
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test the core workflow independently
   - Declare plugins in array ‚Üí automatic loading ‚úì
   - Try experimental plugin ‚Üí loads temporarily ‚úì
   - Sync to declared state ‚Üí experimental removed ‚úì
7. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Task Count**: 68 tasks (Setup + Foundational + US1 + US2 + US3)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T022)
2. Once Foundational is done (after T022):
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T023-T034)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (T035-T048)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (T049-T068)
3. Once US1+US2+US3 complete:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 4 (T069-T088) - requires US2+US3
   - **Developer B**: User Story 5 (T089-T107) - independent
   - **Developer C**: User Story 6 (T108-T116) - requires US1+US3
4. Final integration:
   - **Developer A**: Backward Compatibility (T117-T123)
   - **Developers B+C**: Polish (T124-T139)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within their phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD WORKFLOW**: Write tests first, verify they FAIL, then implement
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All tasks include exact file paths for clear implementation guidance
- Security validation is critical (FR-027) - all user input must be validated
- Performance budgets are enforced through tests (Constitution Principle IV)
- 80%+ test coverage required on reconciliation, state management, adoption logic (Constitution Principle II)
