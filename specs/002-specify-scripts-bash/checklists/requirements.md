# Specification Quality Checklist: Declarative Plugin Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: âœ… ALL CHECKS PASSED

The specification is comprehensive and ready for planning phase. Key strengths:

1. **Clear user scenarios**: 6 prioritized user stories with independent testing criteria
2. **Comprehensive requirements**: 20 functional requirements covering entire declarative paradigm
3. **Measurable success criteria**: 10 concrete, technology-agnostic metrics
4. **Well-defined entities**: Plugin specifications, declared vs. experimental states, state drift
5. **Thorough quality requirements**: Performance budgets, security, observability all addressed
6. **Edge cases covered**: 6 realistic edge cases with defined behavior

**Constitution Compliance**: Fully aligned with Principle VIII (Declarative Configuration) including:
- Configuration model (plugins array as single source of truth)
- Reconciliation (zap sync command)
- Experimentation (zap try for ephemeral state)
- State transparency (zap status, zap diff)
- No hidden state (array + explicit commands only)

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` command to generate implementation plan
