# Tasks: Zsh Plugin Manager

**Feature**: 001-zsh-plugin-manager
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-zsh-plugin-manager/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/cli-interface.md

**Tests**: Per constitution requirement, this feature follows TDD workflow (tests written before implementation). Contract and integration tests are included for all user stories.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. User stories are ordered by priority (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3).

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Project structure**: `zap/` (entry point), `lib/` (modules), `tests/` (test suites)
- **Test structure**: `tests/contract/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/unit/`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Foundational
  - User Story 2 (P1): Can start after Foundational (builds on US1 infrastructure)
  - User Story 3 (P2): Can start after Foundational (independent of US1/US2)
  - User Story 4 (P2): Can start after Foundational (uses loader from US2)
  - User Story 5 (P3): Can start after Foundational (optimizes existing code)
- **Error Handling (Phase 8)**: Can start after Foundational (integrates with all modules)
- **CLI Commands (Phase 9)**: Depends on US1, US2 completion (uses update, list, clean)
- **Compatibility (Phase 10)**: Can run after user stories complete
- **Documentation (Phase 11)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories

- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Completely independent
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Uses loader from US2, but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Optimizes existing modules, independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD workflow)
- Contract tests before implementation
- Integration tests can run parallel with contract tests
- Core implementation after tests written
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase (Phase 1)**:
- T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel (different files)

**Foundational Phase (Phase 2)**:
- T006, T007 can run in parallel (test setup, no code dependencies)
- After T005 (utils.zsh) completes:
  - T008 (parser), T010 (downloader), T012 (loader), T015 (defaults) can run in parallel
  - Corresponding unit tests (T009, T011, T013) can run after their modules

**User Story 1**:
- T016, T017, T018 (all tests) can run in parallel

**User Story 2**:
- T025, T026, T027 (all tests) can run in parallel
- T028, T029 (version pinning, subdirectory support) can run in parallel

**User Story 3**:
- T036, T037 (tests) can run in parallel
- T038, T039, T040 (keybindings) can run in parallel

**User Story 4**:
- T044, T045, T046, T047 (all tests) can run in parallel

**User Story 5**:
- T055, T056 (performance tests) can run in parallel
- T061, T062 (baseline benchmarks) can run in parallel

**Error Handling (Phase 8)**:
- T066, T067, T068, T069, T075 (independent error handling modules) can run in parallel

**CLI Commands (Phase 9)**:
- T078, T079, T080, T081, T082, T085, T087 (all CLI commands and docs) can run in parallel

**Compatibility Testing (Phase 10)**:
- T088, T089 (detection logic) can run in parallel
- T090, T091, T092 (Zsh version tests) can run in parallel
- T093, T094 (platform tests) can run in parallel

**Documentation (Phase 11)**:
- T096, T097, T098, T099, T100, T101 (all documentation tasks) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task T016: "Contract test for installer in tests/contract/test_installer.zsh"
Task T017: "Contract test for zap load parsing in tests/contract/test_load_command.zsh"
Task T018: "Integration test for full installation flow in tests/integration/test_install.bats"

# After tests written and failing, no implementation tasks can run in parallel within US1
# (they depend on sequential completion due to integration)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Add basic error handling from Phase 8
6. Add basic CLI from Phase 9 (help, list)
7. Deploy/demo MVP

**MVP Scope**: Install zap, add plugins via `zap load`, plugins download and load automatically. Shell starts with sensible defaults. Minimal working plugin manager.

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2): ~15 tasks ‚Üí Working infrastructure
2. **MVP** (Phase 3 + minimal Phase 8/9): ~20 tasks ‚Üí User Story 1 + basic error handling + basic CLI ‚Üí Deployable
3. **Full P1** (Phase 4): ~11 tasks ‚Üí Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Update management, version pinning
4. **P2 Features** (Phases 5-6): ~17 tasks ‚Üí Add User Stories 3-4 ‚Üí Default UX + Framework compatibility
5. **Performance & Polish** (Phases 7, 10-11): ~25 tasks ‚Üí User Story 5 + Compatibility + Documentation
6. **Production Ready** (Phase 8-9 complete): ~20 tasks ‚Üí Full error handling + All CLI commands

Each increment adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers after Foundational phase completes:

**Sprint 1** (After Phase 2):
- Developer A: User Story 1 (Phase 3)
- Developer B: User Story 3 (Phase 5) - independent
- Developer C: Error Handling foundation (Phase 8 T066-T069)

**Sprint 2**:
- Developer A: User Story 2 (Phase 4)
- Developer B: User Story 4 (Phase 6)
- Developer C: CLI Commands (Phase 9)

**Sprint 3**:
- Developer A: User Story 5 (Phase 7)
- Developer B: Compatibility Testing (Phase 10)
- Developer C: Documentation (Phase 11)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within the phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- TDD workflow: RED (write failing tests) ‚Üí GREEN (implement) ‚Üí REFACTOR (improve)
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Target 80% test coverage per constitution
- All public functions must have docstrings explaining purpose, parameters, return values, error conditions
- Comments explain WHY (design decisions), not WHAT (code already shows that)
