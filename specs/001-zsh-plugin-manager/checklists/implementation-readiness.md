## Implementation Ambiguities

- [x] CHK058 - Is the mechanism for "deterministic order" loading clear enough to implement? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-008] - **IMPLEMENTED**: FR-008 requires "order listed in config file", zap.zsh processes plugins sequentially in declaration order, no sorting
- [x] CHK059 - Are requirements clear about which plugin files to source (*.plugin.zsh, *.zsh, both)? [Ambiguity, Data-Model §2] - **IMPLEMENTED**: FR-021 defines priority: *.plugin.zsh → *.zsh → init.zsh, lib/loader.zsh:_zap_find_plugin_file implements exact matching order
- [x] CHK060 - Is "framework auto-detection" specific enough to code the detection logic? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-017] - **IMPLEMENTED**: data-model.md §4 specifies repository-based detection (ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh, sorin-ionescu/prezto), lib/framework.zsh implements exact logic
- [x] CHK061 - Are requirements clear about cache directory creation (permissions, parent directory creation)?

## Notes

This checklist validates whether requirements are implementation-ready. Each item asks whether the specification provides enough clarity and detail for a developer to write code without making assumptions. Items marked [Gap] indicate missing requirements that should be added before implementation begins. Items marked [Ambiguity] or [Clarity] indicate requirements that exist but need more precision.

**Focus Areas Validated**:
- Configuration parsing and validation
- Plugin lifecycle management
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance and resource constraints
- Framework compatibility
- Data structures and state management
- User interface (CLI commands, error messages)
- Edge cases and failure modes

## Validation Summary

3. **Partially implemented features** (stubs in place, Phase 9/10 tasks defined):
   - `zap clean`, `zap doctor`, `zap uninstall` commands
   - Plugin manager conflict detection
   - Load order caching (Phase 7)

4. **Requirements fully specified**:
   - All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-038) defined in spec.md
   - Data model complete in data-model.md
   - CLI interface specified in contracts/cli-interface.md
