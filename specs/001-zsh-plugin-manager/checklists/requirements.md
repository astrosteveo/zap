# Specification Quality Checklist: Zsh Plugin Manager

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and the specification is ready for the next phase.

### Details:

**Content Quality**: The specification focuses entirely on what users need and why, without mentioning specific technologies (Zsh shell scripting, Git commands, etc. are mentioned only as user-facing requirements, not implementation details). Written in plain language suitable for product managers and stakeholders.

**Requirement Completeness**: All 15 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria include specific metrics (< 1 second startup, 95% success rate, < 10MB memory overhead). Eight comprehensive edge cases identified. Assumptions section clearly documents platform requirements and constraints.

**Feature Readiness**: Five prioritized user stories with independent test criteria and detailed acceptance scenarios. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "shell startup time" not "Zsh source time", "memory overhead" not "RSS in ps output").

## Notes

The specification is comprehensive and ready to proceed with `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1, P2, P3)
- Each user story is independently testable
- Detailed edge case coverage
- Technology-agnostic success criteria
- Comprehensive assumptions section

No issues or concerns identified.
