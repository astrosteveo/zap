# Quickstart Guide: Zsh Plugin Manager (Zap)

**Feature**: 001-zsh-plugin-manager
**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Audience**: End users (developers using Zsh)

## What is Zap?

Zap is a lightweight, easy-to-use plugin manager for Zsh. It's designed to be a modern alternative to Antigen with:
- Simple, intuitive configuration
- Automatic plugin downloads and updates
- Built-in Oh-My-Zsh and Prezto compatibility
- Fast startup times (< 1 second with 10 plugins)
- Sensible defaults (working keybindings and completions out of the box)

## Installation

### One-Command Install

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/zap/main/install.zsh | zsh
```

### Manual Install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/zap ~/.zap
   ```

2. Add to your `~/.zshrc`:
   ```zsh
   source ~/.zap/zap.zsh
   ```

3. Restart your shell:
   ```bash
   exec zsh
   ```

## Basic Usage

### Loading Your First Plugin

Add this line to your `~/.zshrc` (after sourcing zap.zsh):

```zsh
zap load zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

Restart your shell, and syntax highlighting is active!

### Loading Multiple Plugins

```zsh
# In ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zap/zap.zsh

# Essential plugins
zap load zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
zap load zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
zap load zsh-users/zsh-completions

# Theme
zap load romkatv/powerlevel10k
```

That's it! Zap will:
1. Download each plugin on first shell startup
2. Load them in the order specified
3. Cache them for fast subsequent startups

## Advanced Features

### Version Pinning

Lock a plugin to a specific version:

```zsh
zap load zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions@v0.7.0
```

This ensures the plugin won't change when you update.

### Oh-My-Zsh Plugins

Use any Oh-My-Zsh plugin without installing Oh-My-Zsh:

```zsh
# Load specific Oh-My-Zsh plugins
zap load ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:plugins/git
zap load ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:plugins/kubectl
zap load ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:plugins/docker
```

Zap automatically detects and configures the Oh-My-Zsh environment.

### Prezto Modules

Similarly, use Prezto modules:

```zsh
zap load sorin-ionescu/prezto path:modules/git
zap load sorin-ionescu/prezto path:modules/history
```

### Subdirectory Plugins

Some repositories contain multiple plugins in subdirectories:

```zsh
zap load ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:plugins/git
```

The `path:` annotation tells zap to load only that specific subdirectory.

## Common Tasks

### Updating Plugins

Check for updates:

```zsh
zap update
```

Output:
```
Checking for updates...
  zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting  current
  zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions      v0.7.0 â†’ v0.7.1
  ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh                    pinned (skipped)
  romkatv/powerlevel10k              current

Updated 1 plugin. Restart your shell to apply changes.
```

Update a specific plugin:

```zsh
zap update zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
```

### Listing Installed Plugins

```zsh
zap list
```

Output:
```
Installed plugins:
  zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting  master   âœ“ loaded
  zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions      v0.7.1   âœ“ loaded
  ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh                    master   âœ“ loaded (framework)
  romkatv/powerlevel10k              v1.16.1  âœ“ loaded

Total: 4 plugins
```

For more details:

```zsh
zap list --verbose
```

### Cleaning Cache

Remove temporary files:

```zsh
zap clean
```

Remove everything (requires confirmation):

```zsh
zap clean --all
```

### Troubleshooting

Run diagnostics:

```zsh
zap doctor
```

This checks:
- Zsh and Git versions
- File permissions
- Plugin load errors
- Startup performance issues

## Configuration Examples

### Minimal Setup

```zsh
# ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zap/zap.zsh

zap load zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
zap load zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
```

### Power User Setup

```zsh
# ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zap/zap.zsh

# Performance: syntax highlighting and autosuggestions
zap load zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
zap load zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions@v0.7.0
zap load zsh-users/zsh-completions

# Oh-My-Zsh plugins
zap load ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:plugins/git
zap load ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:plugins/docker
zap load ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:plugins/kubectl
zap load ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:plugins/terraform

# Theme (pinned version for stability)
zap load romkatv/powerlevel10k@v1.16.1

# Additional utilities
zap load zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search
```

### File-Based Configuration

For cleaner separation, use a separate config file:

```zsh
# ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zap/zap.zsh
zap init ~/.zap/plugins.zsh
```

```zsh
# ~/.zap/plugins.zsh
zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions@v0.7.0
ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:plugins/git
romkatv/powerlevel10k@v1.16.1
```

Both approaches work identically.

## Default Features

Zap provides sensible defaults out of the box, even with zero plugins:

### Keybindings

- **Delete**: Deletes character under cursor
- **Home**: Moves to beginning of line
- **End**: Moves to end of line
- **Page Up / Page Down**: Scrolls through command history

### Tab Completion

Basic tab completion works immediately:
- Command completion
- File/directory completion
- Option completion for common commands

## Performance Tips

1. **Pin versions for stability**: Use `@version` to avoid unexpected changes
2. **Load order matters**: Faster plugins first (syntax highlighting before themes)
3. **Monitor startup time**: Run `time zsh -i -c exit` to measure
4. **Use zap doctor**: Identifies slow plugins and suggests optimizations

## Migrating from Other Plugin Managers

### From Antigen

Replace:
```zsh
antigen bundle zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

With:
```zsh
zap load zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

Zap uses the same repository format, so most migrations are search-and-replace.

### From Oh-My-Zsh

Instead of:
```zsh
plugins=(git docker kubectl)
source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
```

Use:
```zsh
source ~/.zap/zap.zsh
zap load ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:plugins/git
zap load ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:plugins/docker
zap load ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:plugins/kubectl
```

Zap automatically handles Oh-My-Zsh setup.

### From Prezto

Replace:
```zsh
zstyle ':prezto:load' pmodule 'git' 'history'
```

With:
```zsh
zap load sorin-ionescu/prezto path:modules/git
zap load sorin-ionescu/prezto path:modules/history
```

## FAQ

### Where are plugins stored?

Plugins are downloaded to `~/.local/share/zap/plugins/` following the XDG Base Directory specification.

### How do I disable a plugin temporarily?

Comment it out in your `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
# zap load zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
```

Restart your shell. The plugin remains cached but won't load.

### How do I remove a plugin completely?

1. Remove the `zap load` line from `~/.zshrc`
2. Run `zap clean --all` to remove the cache
3. Restart your shell

### Why is my shell startup slow?

Run `zap doctor` to diagnose. Common causes:
- Too many plugins (reduce to essentials)
- Heavy themes (try lighter alternatives)
- Network-dependent plugins (ensure they're cached)

### Can I use private Git repositories?

Yes, if you have SSH keys configured:

```zsh
zap load mycompany/private-plugin
```

Zap uses standard Git clone, which respects your SSH configuration.

### What if a plugin breaks my shell?

1. Open a new terminal (starts fresh shell)
2. Edit `~/.zshrc` and comment out the problematic plugin
3. Restart shell or run `source ~/.zshrc`
4. Run `zap doctor` to see error details

Zap never blocks shell startup, so a broken plugin won't lock you out.
